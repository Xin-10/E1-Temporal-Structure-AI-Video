1A-C-3,1A,Cyclic,None,dots,3,"Flat 2D abstract dots move in a repeating horizontal loop pattern, returning to their exact starting positions after each equal-duration cycle. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-C-4,1A,Cyclic,None,dots,4,"A centered group of flat 2D abstract dots completes a motion loop and resets immediately, repeating the same cycle at equal time intervals. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-A-1,1A,Accelerated,None,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots start slowly and continuously accelerate over time from start to end. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-A-2,1A,Accelerated,None,dots,2,"Flat 2D abstract dots begin at a low constant speed, then increase velocity smoothly and continuously until the end of the video. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-A-3,1A,Accelerated,None,dots,3,"Flat 2D abstract dots move forward while accelerating rapidly, with velocity increasing sharply as time progresses. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-A-4,1A,Accelerated,None,dots,4,"Flat 2D abstract dots move forward at a steady slow speed, then accelerate rapidly into a much faster motion, with no pauses or directional changes. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-I-1,1A,Interrupted,None,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots move horizontally along a straight path, pausing completely for short moments between each movement. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-I-2,1A,Interrupted,None,dots,2,"Flat 2D abstract dots move horizontally in a straight line, coming to a complete stop at regular intervals before moving again. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-I-3,1A,Interrupted,None,dots,3,"Flat 2D abstract dots move a short distance along a straight horizontal line, then pause for noticeably longer durations before moving again. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1A-I-4,1A,Interrupted,None,dots,4,"Flat 2D abstract dots move in very short bursts along a straight horizontal path, followed by abrupt, extended pauses that create a strong stop-and-go contrast. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1B-A-T-1,1B,Accelerated,Tension,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots start slowly and continuously accelerate over time from start to end, with the acceleration used to build a growing sense of tension in the pacing. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1B-A-C-1,1B,Accelerated,Calm,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots start slowly and continuously accelerate over time from start to end, with the acceleration intended to sustain a calm, smooth temporal flow. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1B-A-E-1,1B,Accelerated,Emphasis,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots start slowly and accelerate over time, with the acceleration designed to have distinct, easily perceivable stages—such as a noticeable shift from slow to medium to fast—so that the change in speed is easy for the viewer to perceive. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1B-I-T-1,1B,Interrupted,Tension,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots move forward in short, fast bursts and stop abruptly after each burst. The intention is to make each pause feel like an interruption—similar to a motion cut—so the pacing becomes tight and slightly stressful. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1B-I-C-1,1B,Interrupted,Calm,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots move at a steady, moderate speed and ease into a full stop at regular intervals. Each pause is intended to act as a soft breathing space in the motion, keeping the overall pacing calm and even. Static camera on a flat 2D plane. No perspective depth, no tunnel effect, no camera movement."
1B-I-E-1,1B,Interrupted,Emphasis,dots,1,"Flat 2D abstract dots move briefly along a straight horizontal path, then remain completely still for a noticeably extended pause.
